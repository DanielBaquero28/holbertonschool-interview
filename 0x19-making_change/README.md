<h1>Project: Making Change</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we're going to review an exercise that checks if with the coins we have we can give change or not, and if it's posible what is the least number of coins we could the change.</strong></p>
<body>
<li><strong>Task 0:</strong> Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.
<ul>
<li>Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)</li>
<li>Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
<ul>
<li>If total is 0 or less, return 0</li>
<li>If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession</li>
<li>The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0</li>
<li>You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list</li>
<li>Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task</li>
</ul>
</li>
