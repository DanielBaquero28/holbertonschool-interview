<h1>Project: Rain</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we'll cover an exercise done in python3.</strong></p>
<body>
<li><strong>Task 0:</strong> Given a list of non-negative integers representing walls of width 1, calculate how much water will be retained after it rains.
<ul>
<li>Prototype: def rain(walls)</li>
<li>walls is a list of non-negative integers.</li>
<li>Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.</li>
<li>Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are not walls, meaning they will not retain water.</li>
<li>If the list is empty return 0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
