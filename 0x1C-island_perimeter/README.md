<h1>Project: Island Perimeter</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we'll review a Python exercise that finds the perimeter of an island made of 1s in a matrix.</strong></p>
<body>
<li><strong>Task 0:</strong> Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:
<ul>
<li>grid is a list of list of integers:
<ul>
<li>0 represents water</li>
<li>1 represents land</li>
<li>Each cell is square, with a side length of 1</li>
<li>Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).</li>
<li>grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The grid is completely surrounded by water</li>
<li>There is only one island (or nothing).</li>
<li>The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).</li>
</ul>
</li>
