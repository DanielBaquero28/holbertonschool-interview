<h1>Project: Lockboxes</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we'll review about lockboxes. How they're used and best practices when being implemented.</strong></p>
<body>
<li>
<strong>Task 0:</strong> You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.
<ul>
<li>Prototype: def canUnlockAll(boxes)</li>
<li>boxes is a list of lists</li>
<li>A key with the same number as a box opens that box</li>
<li>You can assume all keys will be positive integers</li>
<li>The first box boxes[0] is unlocked</li>
<li>Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False</li>
</ul>
</li>
