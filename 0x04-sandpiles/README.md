<h1>Project: Sandpiles</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we'll learn about a mathematical model called "Sandpiles".</strong></p>
<body>
<li><strong>Task 0:</strong> Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles
<ul>
<li>Prototype: void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3])</li>
<li>You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable</li>
<li>A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains</li>
<li>When your function is done, grid1 must be stable</li>
<li>grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable</li>
<li>Youâ€™re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically</li>
</ul>
</li>
